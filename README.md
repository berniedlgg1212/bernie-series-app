## üìù Project Description & Theme

This application was born from a passion for television series. It serves as a personal dashboard to keep track of watched shows and personal ratings, while also providing a clean interface to discover details about them. The main goal is to provide a simple, beautiful, and functional utility for any series lover to organize and review their viewing history.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Installation and Execution Guide

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or newer recommended)
*   npm (usually comes with Node.js)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [URL of your Git repository]
    cd [repository-folder-name]
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    This command will install all the necessary packages for the project to run.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    You need an API key from TheMovieDB. Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project and add your key:
    ```
    TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
    ```

4.  **Run the Application (in two terminals)**
    This project requires two processes to run simultaneously: the web application and the mock API server.

    *   **In your first terminal**, start the mock API server:
        ```bash
        npm run db:serve
        ```
        This will start the `json-server` on `http://localhost:3001`, which will handle your review submissions.

    *   **In a second terminal**, start the Next.js development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```

5.  **Open the Application**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9002` (or the URL provided by the `npm run dev` command). You should see the application running.
